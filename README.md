# nauticraft-mod
Fabric mod for minecraft 1.15.2 that expands on underwater gameplay elements.
---
## Planned features: 
(In rough order of desired implementation)

Seaglide - A kind of diver propulsion vehicle that increases movement speed underwater when held. Increased underwater mobility is a key component to making underwater gameplay more interesting.

Diving Equipment - Gotta be able to breath. However this equipment should not be infinite, but be easily refillable. Ideally wearing a simple tank and simple mask would increase the amount of time each bubble takes on the hud so that no new gui is needed. Simple tanks are refilled simply by reaching air and waiting. More advanced tanks may require a compressor machine.

Rebreather - A more expensive piece of equipment that does not require an additional scuba tank (although it may not last as long as an advanced scuba tank). You could attach it to your helmet so you don't need to carry anything around

World Gen - Various items that make it totally possible to survive without access to dry land. Craft-able sponges for base building.

Pressure Mechanic - Even with enough air diving to certain depths without adequate equipment will kill you. Ties into the next point.

Ocean World type - No land, you spawn in a small capsule. Water level is considerably higher to allow for a deeper ocean which can be explored. Underground water filled caves with occasional air pockets, interesting flora and fauna.
